# Cyber Torakka
A website designed to track reports made to bug bounty programs for trending purposes or to just manage their response. This is for programs that aren't already managed by a formal reporting platform (e.g., HackerOne, BugCrowd)

## Problem Statement
Different bug bounty programs are not supported through managed platforms and require emails be sent directly to the company. This is to help track those submissions and to streamline submissions 

## Design Principles
- Use as few languages as possible
- One layer per container
- Integrate with scanning pipelines


## Quick Start
TODO


## Architecture
TODO


## Future Plans
Primary goals for this project are as follows:
- Create a simple web page that tracks submissions
- Store results historically and allow updates to submissions
- Add metadata such as payout amount, response times

## Why the name?
Cyber Tracker was already taken. Torakka is the Japanese word for tracker and sounds close enough, so I'm using it.
